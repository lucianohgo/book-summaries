## Foreword

Of the many exceptional leaders we served alongside throughout our military careers, the consistent attribute that made them great was that they took absolute ownership--Extreme Ownership-- not just of those things for which they were responsible, but for everything that impacted their mission. These leaders cast no blame. they made no excuses. Instead of complaining about challenges and setbacks, they developed solutions and solved problems. they leveraged assets, relationships, and resources to get the job done. Their own egos took a back seat to the mission and their troops. These leaders truly *led*.

The most successful men and women we've seen in the civilian world practice this same breed of Extreme Ownership. Likewise, the most successful high-performance teams we've worked with demonstrate this mind-set throughout their organizations.

Once people stop making excuses, stop blaming others, and take ownership of everything in their lives, they are compelled to take action to solve their problems. They are better leaders, better followers, more dependable and actively contributing team members, and more skilled in aggressively driving toward mission accomplishment. But they're also humble--able to keep their egos from damaging relationships and adversely impacting the mission and the team.

Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, and the principles of good leadership do not change regardless of the mission ,the environment, or the personalities of those involved. Leading is Leading.

GET AFTER IT.

## Preface

In the SEAL program, it is all about the *Team*. The sum is far greater than the parts.

Our SEAL operations wer not about us as individuals; The combat scenarios describe how we confronted obstacles as a team and overcame those challenges together. After all, there can be no leadership where there is no team.

As battefield leaders, we learned extremely valuable lessons through success and failure. We made mistakes and learned from them, discovering what works and what doesn't we trained SEAL leaders and watched them implement the principles we ourselves had learned with the same success on difficult battlefields. Then, as we worked with businesses in the civillian sector, we again saw the leadership principles we followed in combat lead to victory for the companies and executives we trained. Many people, both in the SEAL Teams and in the businesses we worked with, asked us to document our lessons learned in a concrete way that leaders could reference.

We wrote this book to capture those leadership principles for future generations, so that they may not be forgotten, so that as new wars begin and end, such crucial lessons will not have to be relearned--rewritten in more blood. We wrote this so that the leadership lessons can continue to impact teams beyond the battlefield in all leadership situations--any company, team or organization in which a group of people strives to achieve a goal and accomplish a mission. We wrote this book for leaders everywhere to utilize the principles we learned to lead and win.

We learned that leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory, particularly when doubters question whether victory is even possible.
